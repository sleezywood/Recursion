# Recursion
Based on user input, program randomly generates a list of numbers and arranges them in ascending or descending order through recursion methods.
Program outputs both unsorted and sorted list of numbers, as well as how many swaps, loops, and comparisons each recursion algorithm (merge code, bubble sort, quick sort, selection sort, insertion sort) takes. 
Program also outputs how long each recursion technique takes to sort list of numbers.
